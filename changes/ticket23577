  o Major features (v3 onion services):
    - When v3 onion service clients send introduce cells, include the IPv6
      address of the rendezvous point, if it has one. v3 onion services running
      0.3.2 ignore IPv6 addresses. In future Tor versions, IPv6-only v3 single
      onion services can use IPv6 addresses to connect directly to the
      rendezvous point.

  o Code simplification and refactoring:
    - To allow v3 onion services to use IPv6 addresses, setup_introduce1_data()
      was modified to take in a node_t instead of an extend_into_t. Closes
      ticket 23577.
