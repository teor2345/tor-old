  o Minor bugfixes (relays, reachability):
    - Check IPv4 ORPort addresses and ports during relay reachability tests.
      Previously, Tor would confirm relay reachability as soon as any create
      cell arrived at any ORPort. This could lead to relays publishing
      incorrect addresses. Fixes bug 17782; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
    - Log IPv4 DirPort addresses and ports during relay reachability tests.
      This makes DirPort checks consistent with ORPort checks.
      Follow-up to 17782.
