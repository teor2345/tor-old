  o Major bugfixes (v3 single onion services, ipv6):
    - Make v3 single onion services put IPv4 addresses in their descriptors.
      Clients get addresses that they can extend to, rather than addresses
      that IPv6-only single onion services can connect directly to.
      Fixes 23493 on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
    - If v3 single onion service can't connect directly to one of its chosen
      intro points, make it connect via a 3-hop path instead.
      In 0.3.2.1-alpha, they would choose intro points, try to put their IPv6
      address in the descriptor, and fail with a BUG() warning.
      Or in rare cases, they would choose intro points excluded by
      ReachableAddresses, but try to connect to them directly.
      Fixes 23493 on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
    - If v3 single onion service can't connect directly to a client-chosen
      rend point, make it connect via a 3-hop path instead.
      In 0.3.2.1-alpha, v3 single onion services would try to choose an
      address they could connect to directly. If they couldn't find one,
      they would fail, or in rare cases, try to connect directly.
      Fixes 23493 on 0.3.2.1-alpha.
    - Fail attempts to connect to unreachable OR addresses
      This is a defence-in-depth measure that prevents clients connecting
      to addresses excluded by ReachableAddresses or ClientUseIPv4/IPv6.
      Diagnostic for 23493, prevents future instances of 23493 and similar
      bugs.
