  o Minor bugfixes (next-generation hidden services):
    - Make HSDir3s reject descriptor POSTs from directly connected services,
      and descriptor GETs from directly connected clients. Also rejects
      POSTs and GETs via directly connected bridges. This ensures that an
      HSDir3 never knows the IP address of a service, client, or bridge.
      Closes ticket 22688.
