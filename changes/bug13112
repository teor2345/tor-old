  o Minor bugfixes (relays, reachability, ipv6):
    - Check IPv6 ORPort addresses and ports during relay reachability tests.
      This change allows relays to receive IPv6 reachability checks.
      Relays don't initiate IPv6 reachability checks yet, see 6939.
      Fixes bug 13112; bugfix on 0.1.0.1-rc.
